      "When the bombs hit, my brother Pete and I were in the coffee-shop adjoining the Balham Underground Station.",
      "The underground is a railway line running under the city. There was a terrible blast of hot air, and a roaring noise like one of todayâ€™s jets taking off.",

      "The lights were out but we could see clearly from the flames just outside. I waited for another explosion, but it did not come.",
      "I was drenched with sweat, more from sheer terror, I think, than from the heat, but I was alive and miraculously unhurt except for a couple of bruises I had got when I had hit the wall. Pete was unhurt too. We were worried about our mother."
