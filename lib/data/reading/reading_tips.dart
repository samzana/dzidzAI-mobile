      "On the ZIMSEC examination, a summary is a question that is graded out of 20. After reading a passage, a student is asked to write a summary of the passage focusing on a specific aspect of the passage.",
  tips: [
    "Identify the key words in the summary question itself. These key words tell you exactly what you are required to do.",
    "Decide what the boundaries of the summary task are. This means deciding which part of the passage is relevant to the question. The summary task may, or may not, involve the whole passage.",
    "Identify the required information from the passage and list this information in brief point form. Always make a list of these points.",
    "Write your summary in continuous prose, by linking the points you have made. Never copy sentences directly from the passage. Use your own words as much as possible, but retain the key ideas from the passage.",
    "Use the following techniques to reduce the number of words you use:\na) Generalise a sequence of events or actions in one word or phrase.\nb) Use one word or phrase to describe similar items or lists of examples.\nc) Link related points in one sentence.",
    "Check the length of your summary. If it is longer than required, shorten it by taking out any unnecessary words, but make sure you do not leave out any important points. Be honest in stating the number of words you have used.",
    "In classwork or homework, write a draft summary, revise it, and polish it before submitting the final version. In exams, train yourself to produce a good first draft that only needs minor revisions."

      "On the ZIMSEC examination, the comprehension section comprises a passage and questions about the passage that students are required to answer.",
  tips: [
    "Make sure to manage your time. Practising with a timer before the exam can help you with managing time and effectively allocating time for each question.",
    "Read the passage carefully. Try to read it at least twice before attempting the questions. Skim it the first time to get familiar with it, then thoroughly read it the second time.",
    "Pay attention to key words in the question because they tell you what to focus on. Words such as why, describe, explain can guide you to the right part of the text.",
    "If you don’t understand a question after multiple reads, skip it and attempt to answer it later to save time.",
    "Follow instructions carefully. Pay attention to the specific instructions in the questions, for example, answer in two sentences/words or give reasons for your answers.",
    "Be specific. Avoid giving vague and general answers. Opt for clear and direct answers for what’s being asked.",
    "Always answer in full sentences unless the question specifically asks for a one-word answer.",
    "When possible, answer in your own words unless asked otherwise. This shows that you understand the text.",
    "Pay attention to context. If you're unsure about the meaning of a word or phrase, try to figure it out by looking at the surrounding sentences. The context can give you clues about the meaning.",
    "Check your answers. Once you've finished answering all the questions, go back and review your answers. Ensure that your responses make sense and are complete.",
    "Stay calm and focused. It’s easy to panic during the exam but staying calm will help you do better."

      "To answer the vocabulary questions of the comprehension section, a student must:",
  tips: [
    "Prepare and practise for this section by reading and trying to decipher meanings of any new words.",
    "Read the passage carefully. Understanding the context before focusing on the specific words can sometimes help you guess the meaning of difficult words based on how they are used in the passage.",
    "Look for clues in the sentence. The words around the unfamiliar word can give hints about its meaning. Pay attention to how the word connects with the rest of the sentence.",
    "Break down the word/phrase. If the word looks difficult, try breaking it into parts (prefix, root, suffix). For example, 'unhappy' can be broken down into 'un-' (not) and 'happy' (feeling good), which means 'not happy.'",
    "Use your own vocabulary knowledge. Think about words you already know that are similar. This can help you make an educated guess about what the new word means.",
    "Substitute with a familiar word. Replace the difficult word with a word you know fits the context. This helps you check if your understanding is correct.",
    "Check the tone of the passage. Is the passage positive or negative? This can guide you in understanding whether a word expresses something good or bad.",
    "Don’t panic if you don’t know the word. Even if you don’t understand a word immediately, the clues from the passage might help you guess the meaning or understand the general idea.",
    "Choose wisely the words you’ll answer out of the eight given.",
    "Revise common vocabulary. Regularly review common words you’ve learned in class, especially those related to topics in the syllabus. This will help you feel more confident.",
    "Manage your time. Don’t spend too long on one word. If you can’t figure it out, move on and come back later if you have time. Focus on what you know to maximise your score."
