29 September 2019

Dear Lucia,

It has been a long time since we last communicated. I thought I was going to meet you during the August holiday so that I could tell you my worries. I believe you are enjoying your stay in your new home in Chisumbanje.

The issue that is worrying me is that my stepmother has ordered that either Tapiwa or myself drop out of school. My brother, Tapiwa, as you may know, is in Grade Six this year. I have been thinking that it would be proper to leave school and seek employment. At least at fifteen, I can be employed as a domestic worker by one of the female teachers at our nearby school.

A number of girls of my age, some of whom I was in the same class with, stopped coming to school and I hear that they are paying fees for their siblings.

Last year, we did not have a good harvest so we hardly had enough food for the six members of our family. It's likely to be the same again this year due to the above-normal rains that we received. The excessive rains this season negatively affected our crops.

You know what Lucy, I have also been thinking about accepting Tichaona's proposal of marriage. I am sure, under the circumstances, I would be happier if I accepted the tempting proposal by the rich man to marry me. His two wives are the best dressed women in our community, and they drive expensive cars. What's your opinion, my dear friend?

I can go on and on, but the truth of the matter is that remaining in school is no longer possible. It actually may mean Tapiwa dropping out of school or me being chased away from home by my parents. They are always quarrelling over payment of school fees for the two of us. I think I may have to give Tapiwa the chance since he is a boy. He will certainly look after the family if he completes secondary education.

I trust I have told you the dilemma I am facing though I have tried to be brief. My friend, life has become unbearable for me. I don’t have any friend that I can confide in ever since your parents moved you from our school.

I need an urgent reply from you, Lucy.

Pass my warm greetings to your aunt, your young sister Tambu, and your new-found friends.

Yours in pain,

Kudzai
