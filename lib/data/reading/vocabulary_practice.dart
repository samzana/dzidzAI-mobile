    passage: [
      "Our government is clearly set on a reconstruction and development course that has at its core, the quantitative and qualitative improvement in educational provision. The nation's greatest resource is its human element. We therefore, need to develop the youths' immense potential and harness it for the future manpower needs of Zimbabwe. The learners we educate are the future of Zimbabwe and we must tailor their education to service the needs of this country. Therefore, we need to make our curriculum uniquely relevant to our own unique situation.",
      "We have so far witnessed a massive expansion in education, particularly in the secondary sector. Such unprecedented expansion was unknown in our country and more is in store for us.",
      "However, an increase in numbers alone will not achieve the desired effect. Government holds the view that education must service all sectors of the economy by developing a wide variety of intellectual, social, economic, technical and agricultural skills that are not only saleable and employable in agriculture, commerce, industry, mining, and scientific research but are characterised by a high enterprise capacity that will see the country fully utilising our inherited natural resources. For education to be relevant, it must develop the capacity to produce youths who are academically and practically equipped to man all sectors of our economy. A look at our past and present scenarios will help to underline the significance of our new thrust. Thousands of youths have pursued an academic type of education. True, some have been able to weave their way into various companies and organisations but the majority have ended up jobless and even helpless after graduating at various exit points. They have a lot of irrelevant academic knowledge without expertise in technical, vocational and scientific fields.",
      "We have a serious situation today where our youths are engrossed in the belief that employment opportunities for them only exist outside the country. Indeed, these youths have the capacity to create employment within the country but the intellectually biased education they received made them feel incompetent. It should be noted that political independence without economic independence is useless. It is therefore, of vital importance for us to control our own economy. We therefore, cannot afford to waste our human resources by continuing to give our youths an irrelevant and one-sided education that only emphasises intellectual skills. That alone will ill-prepare them for life. Zimbabwe needs to be a nation of thinkers and doers; men and women who can integrate ideas and action.",
      "Education, therefore, must be mass-oriented and cease to be a privilege for a few. However, each learner should be educated according to his or her potential, according to his or her academic or practical bent. Those who have a practical bias require the essential theory and practice that go with it and the academically inclined also need a strong dose of practical work. In this way, we will create a nation of workers who will be useful citizens, thus contributing to our national development. We hope to change the negative attitudes to work that have been ingrained in our youths over the years, by helping them appreciate the importance of both academic and practical work and the dignity of labour. None of us can do without the services of the farmer, the carpenter, the designer, the housewife, the electrician, the business person, the mechanic; to mention but a few.",
      "However, a balance between theory and practice, work and study, will not alone produce the effects we envisage. Our youths must learn the basics of production; go through the mill of planting, growing, producing or making and buying and selling, if they are to acquire the skills they will need and if they are to appreciate the value of productive work. Only then can they identify the field in which they will contribute as productive citizens and develop a lasting interest in an area of human endeavour that will be most gratifying in their future lives. In the past, they have not been exposed to a wide range of alternatives. Up to middle secondary school, we hope to have this academic and practical balance so that specialisation will be based on informed judgement.",
      "Now the question is: whose responsibility is it to educate the future adults of our society? As far as the government is concerned, this task rests squarely on the shoulders of parents, teachers, government, and the learners themselves. The government, parents, teachers, and learners should therefore work in unison to ensure that our system of education does not lead to the creation of new social classes. That is to say, instead of creating a degree or diploma-obsessed elite, our education system should produce thoughtful and creative citizens on a broad social base. Once educated, each citizen must relate and apply his/her academic achievements to the problems of society at large.",
      "It would be pointless to educate our people mainly for personal financial gain and high social status. We, as parents, teachers and the government, should invariably act together to produce intellectually sound and inventive members of our future society who will be ready to face the challenge of the growing socio-economic and technological intricacies of the world order.",
      "Here, I must stress that central government cannot leave education in the hands of the parents, teachers and learners alone because there has to be national uniformity. Nevertheless, this uniformity of government policy does not exclude parent participation in the affairs of their local schools. The interests of the parents basically lie in that they want their children to be successful in life. The government's concerns go beyond this. It is imperative for government to define national educational objectives and formulate a comprehensive policy of education, the implementation of which requires the participation of all interested parties, including parents. More importantly, the government has to build more educational facilities in order to produce learners with relevant skills and competencies that will enable them to cope with society's needs at all levels of the socio-economic processes.",
      "Infrastructural development and relevant skills on their own, without sufficient self-discipline will not achieve the desired end. Learners, and teachers alike, must be committed and work tirelessly and selflessly to achieve our national goals. This calls for total devotion to teaching and learning. It means removing immoral inclinations such as truancy, theft, cheating, lying, indulgence in thuggery, drug-taking and over-drinking. It calls for exemplary behaviour and consistent improvement of our performance.",
      "Remember, too, that our independence needs hard and honest work by us. Freedom is only freedom when it is circumscribed by discipline and responsibility. We are responsible to ourselves, our families, our schools, our government and the nation. We dare not disappoint the nation for the trust it has reposed in us."

    passage: [
      "When the bombs hit, my brother Pete and I were in the coffee-shop adjoining the Balham Underground Station. The underground is a railway line running under the city. There was a terrible blast of hot air, and a roaring noise like one of today's jets taking off. Then, I was lifted from the stool and hurled to the floor just under the big window. The glass had shattered; there were bits sticking out of everything. The lights were out but we could see clearly from the flames just outside. I waited for another explosion, but it did not come.",
    "I was drenched with sweat, more from sheer terror, I think, than from the heat, but I was alive and miraculously unhurt except for a couple of bruises I had got when I had hit the wall. Pete was unhurt too. We were worried about our mother.",
    "We tried to go up Station Road to our usual shelter in the cellar of the fish-and-chips shop, but the police turned us back. There was a lot of shouting and screaming and people running. Rescuers were still trying to get down to the people below in Balham Underground Station, so we ran up the High Road.",
    "Then, the guns on Green Common opened up, and we heard the drone of another Heinkel. You could always tell a Heinkel because its engines seemed to be misfiring. We dived for cover behind a mound of debris that I think was a bakery the day before. The bombs came down about half a kilometre away.",
    "When we reached the shelter, everyone was all right. Mother was crying. She said she thought she had lost us. Lotta was singing. Lotta was the shopkeeper's daughter, and though not blessed with the gift of music or voice, she insisted on, 'keeping up spirits' of her 'captive audience far too often for my liking. Unfortunately, she seemed to know only two songs all the way through: 'All the Things You Are' and 'We'll Meet Again.'",
    "It was October 14, 1940, the night we lost our second house, the 38th night of the great air bombardment of London, later to become famous forever as the Blitz.",
    "'For fifty-seven nights, the bombing of London was unceasing,' Winston Churchill was to write in Their First Hour. Never before was so wide an expanse of houses subjected to such bombardment or so many families required to face its problems and terrors.",
    "Then, fifty years later, I left my Canadian home to return to Balham, chiefly to find out who and what still remained among the fragments of my childhood. I also returned with mixed emotions. I searched for old friends, looking for fresh faces I knew then, and I could not find them. However, the streets were the same.",
    "Balham was referred to in those days as lower-middle to working class, according to which end of the town you lived in. It stretched a little more than a kilometre from Clapham South Station, at the top of the hill to Balham Station. It was well served for its size, boasting three cinemas, countless pubs, and at the bottom of the hill, the Hippodrome Music Hall, known simply as the Balham Hip.",
    "They are gone now. Where the Hip had stood is an ultra-modern apartment block. The picture house had been replaced by a super-drug store. John Best, the butcher I worked for each Christmas, plucking turkeys in a cold back room for a few pence a bird, had gone too.",
    "Yet, I discovered that a few places remained: Woolworths and the old public school in Oldridge Road and the greengrocer, R. Kelly and Sons. The Kellys have been in business there since 1938, and Bob, the grandfather still puts in a half day's work, helping his nephew Alan run the business. Even the coffee-shop is still there. It is called Nick's Quick Snacks now.",
    "Just before five-o'clock on the afternoon of September 7, 1940, the first wave of German bombers, some 300 of them, escorted by twice as many fighters, followed the River Thames to London, dropping their bombs on the Royal Arsenal, power stations, gasworks, and the kilometres of docks that lined the river. Many port records of the time were destroyed in the bombing, but Bob Aspinall of the Museum in Docklands, told me that there were possibly as many as 500 ships, carrying half a million tons of food and other vital supplies moored that night. By late evening, many of them were on fire or sinking, or very often both.",
    "On that first night, the twins, Lily and Ethel Wilkins, were preparing to sit down to tea with their family in East Ham when the siren wailed. Like hundreds of thousands of other school children, including my two younger sisters, they had been evacuated from London the previous summer as war threatened and, like countless others, they had returned to the city as months passed without danger. 'We were eleven years old and had no idea of what was going on,' Lily told me. 'The air raid warden came and told us to go to the school, where there was a bomb shelter. There was no time to pack anything, we just got up from the table and left.",
    "We sat in the school all night and heard the bombs. In the morning, we were told we had to find our own way to a safer place. My father had a brother in Walthamstow, about five kilometres away. The streets were just piles of rubble, and fire engines and hosepipes were everywhere, blocking the roadway. We had to walk. Ethel's feet were bleeding because she had no shoes or socks, so my father wrapped them in a scarf and a handkerchief. As we walked down Crownfield Road, a lady saw Ethel's feet and gave her a pair of shoes. Crownfield Road was hit the following night. The lady's house was demolished.",
    "In nearby Stepney, Len Webb, who was twelve, and his family, huddled in the prefabricated Anderson Shelter in their backyard. 'I remember that we'd been in the shelter for a long time. It was very hot and stuffy,' he recalled as we sat in the garden last year. 'Then the bomb hit the house. First, we heard the swish as it came down. You knew it was near if you heard the swish. We heard an explosion and at the same time the shelter heaved up and down and filled with dust and smoke. We could see flames. Then the house must have collapsed because we got covered in bricks and dust.'",
    "We tried to get out,' he went on, 'but the entrance was blocked with bricks and rubble. We started to dig our way out with our hands. A lot of the rubble was too heavy to move and I thought we were going to die there. After a little while, we heard a rescue squad and we yelled to tell them we were still inside. There was just an empty space where the house was earlier on that day, and a lot of the other houses had gone too.'",
    "My father decided to take us to my uncle's. It took us a long time to walk there. A lot of times we had to find shelter again because the bombs kept coming all night. When we got there, they were all in a street shelter, so we went in too. At about four in the morning, a bomb hit really close. After it had cleared, we went to my uncle's house, but it wasn't there anymore. We had been bombed out twice in the same night.",
    "Len looked up with a rueful smile. 'It's a pity we weren't in the rubble business then,' he said in his gentle way. 'We'd have made a fortune.'",
    "There was no end. Night after night they came. We watched from the rooftops as the bombs kept edging closer. They hit around the Elephant and Castle area, then at Kennington, just a few underground stops from Balham. The East End was still burning. Grace Dalton who was eleven, lived near the Royal Docks in Silvertown, one of the first and hardest hit areas.",
    "She said, 'I was blowing out the candles on my birthday cake when the first bombs hit. Another lot hit the dock just behind our street. We did not have an air-raid shelter, so my father decided to take us anywhere the buses were going. However, there were no buses. I remember being mad that my party was spoiled, so on the way out, I crammed my pockets full of cake.'",
    "It looked as if the river was on fire,' Grace continued, 'and I didn't think we would get away. There was a street shelter, so we went in there. I was hungry and ate my cake. It was all squashed up from being in my pocket. I didn't care. When we looked out in the morning, most of the houses were gone. All that was left were broken pieces still on fire,' she lamented.",
    "The Council relocated us to a big house in Hendon, kilometres away from the docks, but my grandfather refused to go. He said he was born in Silvertown and nobody was going to make him leave. He was killed a few days later when a direct hit demolished the house."

    passage: [
      "José Ramos was an outpost rider for a big cattle ranch in the Matto Grosso jungle of Brazil. He lived with his wife on a small ranch sixteen kilometres up the river from my camp. Jose looked after the herds of the big ranch and also ran his own small herd. One day, he appeared at my camp in a very distressed state, 'You must come with your dogs! Assassin has begun raiding again and has killed twelve of my cattle!'",
      "The name, Assassin, was well known in the region. Several years before, this enormous jaguar had been wounded by a hunter who had shot too hastily while the jaguar was in a tree. The infuriated animal had bounded down and the hunter had fled, leaving his dogs to the mercy of the large jaguar, which destroyed them.",
      "Thereafter, apparently through some jungle cunning, the jaguar understood that a hunter with a rifle could not kill him in the tall thick grass. He was never again seen in a tree, but would rove through the marsh grass, killing cattle wantonly. His experience had left him with a deadly hatred of dogs. He learned to draw them in pursuit of him through the grass, then circle and crouch beside his own trail, springing at them as they ran by. One sweep of his razor claws would destroy a dog, and then the jaguar would lope on, repeating the manoeuvre on each dog that followed. It was this trick of ambushing pursuers that gave Assassin his name.",
      "Jose had no trained dogs capable of tracking Assassin and bringing him to bay. Unfortunately, I had recently lost my lead dog.",
      "I am sorry, Jose,' I said. 'I can't risk the dogs I have left against that devil. He will kill them as fast as I send them after him'.",
      "In that case,' he said quietly, 'I shall go after Assassin myself - without dogs. I must kill the devil or he will ruin me.' He rode off towards his ranch.",
      "A few days later, I saw vultures circling in the still hot air west of the river. I leashed Raivoso, Pedro and Vine, three of my best dogs, and started across the marshes. Within a short time, the dogs found the kill, a small marsh deer. The dogs went and I followed. Soon, we found a second kill, and then two more. Suddenly, I heard Raivoso's deep bay, and knew from the sound that he was on Assassin's track. I collared the other dogs, and this probably saved them from destruction. It was useless to follow Raivoso through the marsh grass. A staccato of sharp yaps ending on a shrill, screaming note told the story: he had caught up with the jaguar and had been killed in ambush. I knew I must hunt this killer.",
      "Back in my camp that night, I thought out a plan. I would use the dogs to pick up the trail and bring me within a reasonable distance of the jaguar. Then, I would leave the dogs on leash and follow the spoor alone, hoping that I would find Assassin in an open area where I could kill him with a shot or an arrow. To do this, I needed someone to watch the dogs. I decided to ride to Jose's ranch the next day.",
      "The following morning, little Tupi, still a puppy, started yapping and, as I looked down the river trail, I saw Maria, Jose's wife, riding towards my camp at a gallop. As she pulled up the horse, I saw that the animal's flank had two gashes which had bled freely, and there was blood on the wooden saddle.",
      "Maria's eyes were wide open with terror. 'Mr Siemel, José went after Assassin - and only the horse came back!'",
      "I saddled my horse and coupled Pedro, Vinte and Leao, my best remaining dogs, to the leash. As I started away, my puppy, Tupi, set up a great yapping, and I tied him to a post near the hut. Then Maria and I rode off to pick up her husband's track into the jungle.",
      "I spotted vultures circling ahead and when we broke through a patch of undergrowth into a burnt area where the grass was short, I saw a man lying on the ground. His body had been badly mangled. It was José. I heard a small cry behind me and turned to see Maria slipping from her horse. I ran over and caught her. She recovered quickly and, after a minute or two, agreed to ride back to her ranch.",
      "Then I planned my campaign. Assassin had attacked a man on a horse once; he would do it again. I could not use a spear while in the saddle, so I tied my horse to a tree in a clearing. I took my spear, my bow and a couple of arrows. I had a pistol in my holster but no rifle, which would have been useless in the high grass. In any case, I would never count on a bullet to stop a charging jaguar.",
      "My plan was to unleash the dogs and follow as fast as I could on foot. If I could stay close enough, I could force Assassin to attack me. With bow in one hand and spear in the other, I started after the dogs, running low in the grass. In perhaps ten minutes, I heard Pedro baying in the lead. Then, there was a shrill scream. When I reached the spot, Pedro was on the ground, his side ripped open. I did not stop, hoping to overtake the other dogs, but a second scream told me that the murderer had made another kill.",
      "I had run perhaps a quarter of a kilometre since the first dog was killed when I found the last, Lea, lying near the edge of the clearing. I stood for a moment, sick with rage, not knowing what to do next. Suddenly, there was a yapping in the grass behind me and out bounded Tupi, barking joyously. He had chewed his tether and followed us.",
      "At that moment, I heard a rustling in the heavy grass across the clearing. I had dropped my spear when I stepped forward to catch Tupi. Tupi barked and ran around in circles excitedly, totally ignorant of the danger confronting him. I dared not use my revolver, since Assassin was already gun-shy and the noise would probably frighten him into flight. I fitted an arrow silently onto my bow. There was no sound. Time stood still. All movement and sound ceased as if waiting for a conclusion to this event. Patience tested us. As soon as I saw movement, I let fly. The arrow apparently struck something, but how damaging the shot was I did not know. Tupi was still continuing his frenzied barking. I was relying on Tupi's barking to bring the beast in my direction. Now, there was commotion in the grass, and although it was so dense that I could not see two metres through it, I felt sure of my target. Silence. There was total silence. I took aim with the remaining arrow. Again, time stood still. I felt I could wait no longer. Fate would decide the outcome of this battle, an isolated skirmish in the jungle. I shot again.",
      "Suddenly, a long, yellowish shape broke from the grass and streaked across the clearing. Assassin, in pain from an arrow through his shoulder, had reverted to instinct and was running for the refuge of a tree. He saw me as he neared the tree and swerved towards me. In one motion, I picked up my spear and was ready to lure the jaguar into a charge.",
      "The open area in which Assassin and I faced each other was about thirty metres across. Assassin was weaving back and forth, every so often shaking his head and letting out a snarl. I edged towards him so that he would charge me. His eyes glared angrily. We must have been considering the same thing - when to make the vital move. As I moved closer, my ears caught the whirr of a vulture apparently alighting on a nearby tree. This diverted my attention and the wily Assassin chose that instant to charge.",
      "I missed being killed by a single step. As the jaguar lunged, I managed to pivot and drive the spear at his neck. The spear did not pierce deeply, but the thrust was enough to throw him off balance. He was sideways to me now, his head turned, white teeth flashing, but he did not charge. I could not attack, since I would not have the strength to drive the spear home. Then, while I was desperately casting about for some way of provoking a charge, he gave a snarling roar and leaped straight at me.",
      "I barely had time to lift the point of my spear and direct it. I could feel the hot breath against my face and arms as the spearhead drove into his throat high over the chest. With every ounce of strength I had, I rammed the blade in deeper. Any other jaguar I had fought would have had the life drained away by this combination of wounds, but Assassin clawed furiously, even after I had got a downward thrust on the spearhead and was literally driving the point into the ground. Then he went limp; his great, slashing claws stilled forever.",
      "For a few minutes, I rested on my spear, too exhausted to draw it out of the bloody carcass. Tupi, who had retired to the edge of the clearing while the battle raged on, now came dancing madly about as if to claim the kill, an honour I was quite glad to conced.",
      "Later, after I had taken the mangled remains of Jose to his home and arranged for the grief-stricken Maria and her child to be taken to the big ranch, I returned to the scene of the battle. I measured Assassin's carcass. He was almost four metres from nose to tip! I could only estimate his weight, but it must have been close to one-hundred and eighty kilogrammes."
